- [Difference between compliled and interpreted languages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compiled-and-interpreted-language/)
    - Compiled Language
        - Compilation errors prevent the code from compiling
        - The language delelivers better performance
        - The program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable
        - Types of compiled language â€“ C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL,

    - Interpreted Language
        - All debugging occurs at run-time
        - The language delivers relatively slower performance
        - The instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program
