# Object Oriented Programming 

- OOPs Concepts:
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance

- Encapsulation:
    - Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (instance variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit like a Class.
    - In encapsulation, the variables of a class can be made hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
    - It can be described as a protective barrier that prevents the code and data being randomly accessed by other code defined outside the class. Access to the data and code is tightly controlled by a class.
    - Encapsulation leads to data hiding.
    - We use access specifiers to hide the data(properties) and methods. Use of private and public comes under this.

- Abstraction:
    - Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
    - In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
