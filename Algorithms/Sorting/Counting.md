# Counting Sort

## Explanation

- Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the array.
- The count is stored in an auxiliary array and the sorting is done by mapping the count as an index of the auxiliary array.

### Working of Counting Sort
