# Merge Sort

## Explanation

- Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
- Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually. Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity

  - Best Case Complexity: O(n\*log n)
  - Worst Case Complexity: O(n\*log n)
  - Average Case Complexity: O(n\*log n)

- Space Complexity

  - The space complexity of merge sort is O(n).

- Stability : Yes
