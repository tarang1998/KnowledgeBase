## Functional Programming 

- Functional programming is all about building functions for immutable variables.
- Concepts of functional Programming :
    - Pure functions:
        - They produce the same output for same arguments irrespective of anything else
        - They have no side effects, they do not modify any arguments or local/global variables or input/output streams. This property is also called as immutability.

    - Recursion
    - Referential Transperency 
        - Variables once defined do not change their value throughout the program.
    - Functions are first class and can be Higher order.
    - Variables are immutable 

- Applications:
    - It is used in mathematical computations.
    - It is needed where concurrency or parallelism is required.
