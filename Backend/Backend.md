    - Disadvantages of a monolith architecture 
        - A new member in the team needs to have more context of the entire system as the system is tightly coupled
        - Deployments are complicated
        - Testing the application is tougher
        - Single Point Of Failure

    - Advantages of a microservice architecture
        - Parallel development is easy as services are loosely coupled

## APIs

### Videos

- [What is an API and how do you design it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YlYuNMTCc8)
    - An API shouldnt have any side effects 
        - It should do exactly the task the API name stands for and nothing else
        - The API should be atomic
    - API response
        - Pagination
        - Fragmentation

## Languages 

- Fact : Whatsapp needs only 50 engineers for its 900M users because Erlang is used to implement its concurrency needs. Facebook uses Haskell in its anti-spam system.
