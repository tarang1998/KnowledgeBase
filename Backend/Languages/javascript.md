# Node.js

- Node.js is not a programming language. Rather, it’s a runtime environment that’s used to run JavaScript outside the browser.
- Global variables in Node ?

- Node.js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications. 

- It runs on the Chrome's V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and it uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.

- It is a asynchronous, event driven javascript runtime designed to build scalable network applications.

- Javascripts execution in Node.js is single threaded.

- What is event loop ?
    - The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

    - [The node.js event loop](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-loop)

- Blocking is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. 
- This happens because the event loop is unable to continue running JavaScript while a blocking operation is occurring.

- Since Node.js is sihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE ngle threaded, CPU intensive is not its strong suite
