### Database Sharding 

- Data can be partitioned in two ways : Horizontal partitioning and Vertical partitioning
    - In horizontal partitioning data is partitioned on the basis of rows
    - In vertical partitioning data is partitioned on the basis of columns 
- Horizontal Partitioning is also known as sharding 
- Advantanges of sharding 
    - It reduces latency hence better performance
    - The conditional of single point of failure is avoided if the database is physically sharded
- Drawbacks of sharding
    - Could lead an overloaded data partition if the key is not choosen properly, thereby creating hotspots.
    - Its very difficult to revert the database from a sharded to a non-sharded architecture
    - Data Join operations are complex - cases in which data belongs to different shards

### API Rate Limiter

- 429 is the error code that is used which indicated that too may request were made
- The functional requirements of the API rate limiter:
    - Should return a bool value if the requets can be allowed or not
- The non functional requirements of the API rate limiter:
    - Low latency 
    - Accurate 
    - Scalable 
- The simplest algorithm to implement in the API Rate Limiter is the token bucket algorithm

    - Horizontal and Vertical Scaling 
        - In the vertical scaling approach the computational power of the server is increased
        - In horizontal scaling the no of servers are increased

        - Horizontal Scaling 
            - Load Balancing is Required 
            - Network Calls (RPC) are involved 

        - Vertical Scaling 
            - Chances for a single point of failure
            - Inter process communication
            - Limited by hardware
