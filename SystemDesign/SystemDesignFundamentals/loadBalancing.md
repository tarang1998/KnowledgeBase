# Load Balancing 

- Load balancing is the process of spreading request across muliple resources according to some metric (random, round-robin) and their current status(available for request , not responding, elevated error rate) to improve responsiveness and availablity of the application or the website 
- Load needs to be balanced not only between the user requests and the web servers but at every stage to achieve full scalability and redundancy for the system. A large system may balance load at three layers:
 - User to web Servers 
 - Web Servers to Internal Platform Layer 
 - Internal Platform layer to the database
