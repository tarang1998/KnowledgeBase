# Scaling 

Scalability refers to the applications ability to handle and withstand an increased workload without sacrifing latency

- Horizontal and Vertical Scaling 
    - In the vertical scaling approach the computational power of the server is increased
    - In horizontal scaling the no of servers are increased

    - Horizontal Scaling 
        - Load Balancing is Required 
        - Network Calls (RPC) are involved 

    - Vertical Scaling 
        - Chances for a single point of failure
        - Inter process communication
        - Limited by hardware
